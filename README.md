# Competitive Programming

## Background
- Recently this year, LLMs have achieved the scores of average gold medalists
  - OpenAI trained a model that scored 213 points and ranked in the 49th percentile in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI): https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/133874
  - With a problemset coverage of 88% of IMO geometry problems, AlphaGeometry2 solved 42 out of 50 in the IMO-AG-50 benchmark: https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/02/10/google-deepmind-introduces-alphageometry2-a-significant-upgrade-to-alphageometry-surpassing-the-average-gold-medalist-in-solving-olympiad-geometry/
 
## Opportunity
- Computers are approaching near-human level experience with known mathematical problems
- However, they struggle with novel mathematical insights: sub-optimizations do not count!
- Also, computers struggle with both commmon sense and intricate systems design and engineering problems

## Why Care
- The industry has already mentioned an upper limit on model attrition: even with increased model parameters and better hypertuning
- This may be God's Jacob Ladder boundary... symbolic reasoning could be our CS barrier. It may be unobtainable
  - For all of the benefits true, general purpose symbolic reasoning could bring. I actually pray its unobtainable. This would make it easier for everyone.

## Gist
- Studying CP approaches may be MORE important than ever before
- With DS & Algos at your fingertips, you can have the computer do "routine" tasks
- Routine tasks change per generation: ours is working out the engineering constraints

## Be An Engineer Of The Future
- Through near real-time contraint and optimization checks, we (Humans) have been empowered with speed of thought AGILE iterations
